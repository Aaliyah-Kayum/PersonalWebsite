    <h1>A little bit about Mitzi...</h1>
<p>We don't know much about her...</p>

<h3>How did we meet?</h3>
<p>It was the summer of 2017, I was a high school freshman back then, still had a small margin of hope I'd be happy.</p>
<p>Anyways, my parents brought in this scruffy, 3 to 4-week-old kitten and said "this is for you." This pound and a half of ugly grey fur could barely walk on its own. It was too stupid to eat on its own as well, I had to bottle feed it milk which was a really messy business.</p>
